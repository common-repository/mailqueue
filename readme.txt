Store all emails in database and send them later.

== Description ==
This plugin  blocks the immediate sending of emails, thanks to which you can save the email content, recipient, hidden recipients, the content of the email headers before sending it, as a custom post type.
Saved emails can be viewed and modified in the administration panel in the form of a mailing list, you can then send them manually.
In addition, the plugin has an implemented cron, which every 15 minutes checks which e-mails are ready to be sent (based on the status of the e-mail) and sends them using the swift e-mails library.
